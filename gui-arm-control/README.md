## gui-arm-control

### Current Tasks (phase 3)

Sprint 1:
- consult with motor-interface/arm-comms on expected data/format
- create design (even if just on paper) for the full gui panel.

Sprint 2:
- implement the code for the gui based of design, assume to fill with dummy variables for all panels, unless otherwise specified below.

```
Arm-Position panel: integrate max's matlab code. First start with workspace code, then inverse kinematics code.
