# To get the values for ID_PATH for each plugged in camera you can use the following line
# `udevadm info -q all /dev/video7 | grep ID_PATH=`
# Note that the way the odroid seems to work is that it first assigns 7 and then goes down from that
# so if you have 3 cameras it would be video7,6,8.
# To quickly test if that camera actually works (without the GUI) you can run `./start_stream.sh /dev/video{number}`
# to see if the proper camera starts. Vist http://{odroid_ip_address}:8090/?action=stream to view it.

# currently implemented orientation on usb hub, from left to right: Rear, Front, Arm/Science
