# tests
This is where we keep our tests and group them according to type.
So far we have some sample unit tests, and an empty folder for feature tests.

## unit tests
Testing an individual unit, such as a method (function) in a class, with all dependencies mocked up.

## functional tests
AKA Integration Test, testing a slice of functionality in a system. This will test many methods and may interact with dependencies like Databases or Web Services.
