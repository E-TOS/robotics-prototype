The demo consists of two files that work together to communicate between PC and Arduino: ComArduino.py and ArduinoPC.ino

Summary of both files:
---------------------
ComArduino.py
---------------------
__PROCEDURE__
Opens serial connection to the arduino, which causes the arduino to reset.
Waits for message from arduino to give it time to reset.
Loops through a series of test messages:
- Send message and display it on PC screen
- wait for a reply and display it on the PC
- any message sent with length = 0 from Arduino is interpreted as a debug message (prints to PC screen)

__SENDING MESSAGES__
To send a message to the arduino, we must preface the message with a start marker byte value of 254.
The following byte will contain the number of characters in the original message, then the message follows.
The message ends with a end marker byte of 255.

__RECEIVING MESSAGES__
